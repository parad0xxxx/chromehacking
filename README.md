# get_chrome
get_chrome (get_chrome.py) reads and writes binary information found in Google Chrome's database to harvest saved passwords, and writes those into a .txt format.

# Downloads
```https://github.com/parad0xxxx/get_chrome/releases```

# Data
• Chrome passwords
• OS username
• User's Public IP address
• User's Private IP address
• Shows windows opened
• And the time data was recorded

# Python
*  This was made with Python 3.7.5 (Windows)

# WARNING!
* Not all functions are stable, depending on what OS you're running.
*  This was intended and designed on a Windows operating system, but we're trying our best to adapt for other systems.
// Please wait for a stable release if you're using either Linux or MacOS.

# Note
  * This works on all Python versions.
  * Don't have Python? Download it here! https://www.python.org/downloads/
  
# Who made this?
* parad0x (front-end developer)
* snavellet (back-end developer[APIs]) 

# Some Cool Features
  - Write saved passwords into a .txt file
  - Use smtplib to send that file to an email address
  - Write & Delete saved information (newly created .txt file)
# Updates
    • Added Linux and MacOS support (beta) - Use at your own risk.
    • Removes all console recognition by user. (You can modify the script to your expertise)
    • Added chrome directory solutions for all OS.
    • Added statements to read if your device is running the ideal version of get_chrome.py
    • Removed 'noname' attachment bug with proper results.txt and added a guide on how to use it.
    
# Reminders
    • Remember to replace '' string to YOUR details. (this will prevent any runtime errors)
    • If you would like to modify this software, please FORK it. :)    
    
# Ideas
    • Make chrome.py a library on pypi(pip)
    • Make it fully user accessible.
