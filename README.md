ChromeHacking (chrome.py) reads and writes binary information found in Google Chrome's database to harvest saved passwords, and written those into a .txt format.

# ```Some Cool Features```
  - Write saved passwords into a .txt file
  - Use smtplib to send that file to an email address
  - Write & Delete saved information (newly created .txt file)


# Ideas
    • Make chrome.py a library on pypi(pip)
    • Make it fully user accessible
